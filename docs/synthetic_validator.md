# Full instructions for setup

NOTE: first setup takes a while, there's a lot of models!

### Hardware
Setups tested for mining so far:


**NOTE** Some GPUS (especially on runpod) are unable to load the pipelines into memory.

If you see an issue where the checking servers / safety servers are unable to start, chances are your GPU is incompatible.

There is a bug with the hugging face diffusers library and certain GPU's.

| Name  | CUDA Version | Ubuntu Version | Python Version | Works |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| H1OO  | 12.0 | 22.04 | 3.10.12 | ✅  |
| A100 | 11.8  | 22.04 | 3.10.12 | ✅ / ❌ (hit and miss) |
| RTX 4090 | 11.8  | 22.04 | 3.10.12 | ✅ |
| A6000* | 12.0   | 22.04 | 3.10.12 |✅ |
| A40 | 12.0   | 22.04 | 3.10.12 | ✅ |
| L40 | 12.0   | 22.04 | 3.10.12 | ❌ |
| A100 SXM | 11.8  | 22.04 | 3.10.12 | ❌|

Note: That's not to say you can't use other GPU's!

* Recommended - I advise you to use a A6000

### Validators
GPU: 1x80 GB or 1x24GB or 1x48GB

Storage: 200Gb

## Setup steps

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/namoray/vision
cd vision
```


### Install system dependencies

If you are in a container such as runpod, run these:

```bash
### Install pm2 & jq
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install nodejs npm -y
npm i -g pm2
apt-get install -y jq

### Install nano so you can edit the config easily
apt-get update
apt-get install nano -y

### Install lsof so you can see ports not in use
apt-get install lsof
```

If you are on a bare metal machine (e.g. Vast) where you require `sudo`, use the following:
```bash
### Install pm2 & jq
sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
sudo npm i -g pm2
sudo apt-get install -y jq

### Install nano so you can edit the config easily
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nano -y

### Install lsof so you can see ports not in use
sudo apt-get install lsof
```


### Install python dependencies
Make sure you have installed the correct python version, and then follow these steps:

```bash
### Install the local python environment
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
pip install -r git_requirements.txt
```

If for some reason that doesn't work, you may need to use `pip3`;
```bash
### Install the local python environment
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -e .
pip3 install -r git_requirements.txt
```


### Download the necessary models
Simple step this one - note it may take a while if you have poor bandwidth

```bash
./get_models.sh
```


**If you are renting a virtualized GPU e.g. on runpod:**

Before you make the config, run the command
```bash
lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
```

This shows you all the ports currently in use. When you come to choose a `CHECKING_SERVER_ADDRESS` and `SAFETY_CHECKER_SERVER_ADDRESS`, make sure the ports you choose aren't already in use.

Example output:
![image](images/ports_in_use.png)

This shows that ports 9091, 3001, .., 34579, 41133 etc, are currently in use, so pick address that don't include these.

Typically the default values I provide will work :)

make sure to leave the `API_SERVER_PORT` value empty if you're running in synthetic only mode!

#### Creating the config

```bash
vision create-config
```

### Creating the database
Used to store scoring logs

```bash
curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/dbmate https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate/releases/latest/download/dbmate-linux-amd64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dbmate

dbmate --url "sqlite:validator_database.db" up
```

#### Starting the server

### With autoupdates

> **WARNING:** Autoupdates will work best if you use the `one gpu for all` setting in the config - otherwise if there is a new model we won't know what to do!

```bash
pm2 start --name run_validator_auto_update "python run_validator_auto_update.py"
```

### Without auto updates
```bash
./validation/run_all_servers.sh
```

This uses the config defined in the `config.yaml`.
